# optimising-a-simple-DNN-model-and-Densenet-121-using-frankwolfe-algorithm-with-lâˆž-constrained-
built a customized constrained optimization function using frank-wolfe algorithm and l1 ball constrain.
used fix, decaying and cyclic learning rates.
with two different models of a simple DNN and densenet121 on Cifar-10 and dry bean data sets
